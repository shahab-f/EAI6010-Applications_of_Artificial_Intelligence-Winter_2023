### Neural style transfer using TensorFlow Hub
### ABSTRACT
This code demonstrates neural style transfer using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub. It loads pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub to generate stylized images. The code imports necessary modules, defines a function to load and preprocess images, and applies neural style transfer to example images of the Golden Gate Bridge and The Great Wave off Kanagawa. It also allows users to upload their own images for stylization and outputs the content image, style image, and stylized image.

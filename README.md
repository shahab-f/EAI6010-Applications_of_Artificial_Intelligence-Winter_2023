### Python Image Processing Techniques and CNN for Handwritten Digit Classification
### ABSTRACT
This Python code showcases various image processing techniques using OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, such as generating histograms, finding contours, and applying mathematical operations to grayscale images. It also demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, with experiments on different model parameters and architecture.

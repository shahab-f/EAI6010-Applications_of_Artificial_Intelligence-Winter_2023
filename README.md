### Retrieving and Visualizing Historical Litecoin Prices Using Python and Bokeh
### ABSTRACT
This assignment demonstrates the process of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing historical cryptocurrency price data using Python's Pandas and Bokeh libraries. The code retrieves Litecoin's (LTC) price data from the Cryptowatch API using the requests library and converts it into a DataFrame using Pandas. The closing prices of LTC are plotted over time using both Pandas and Bokeh, and the price data is then exported to an Excel file using Pandas. This methodology can be applied to other cryptocurrencies and exchanges by adjusting the API endpoints and parameters.
